# Phaser Minesweeper Board

This project is a small Phaser demo that generates a **Minesweeper board**.  
It focuses on the logic for creating the board layout and placing mines, as well as cell selection â€” the actual gameplay is not included.

## What I Used

## What I Learned
- How to use Phaser for basic game setup  
- Implementing grid-based logic for games
